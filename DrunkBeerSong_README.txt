Professor Tapia,

I decided to use the lyrics for the drinking song that I grew up singing (though it was about soda at that time) by using the phrases, "...If this bottle happens to fall, what a waste of alcohol..." and at the end potentially prepetuating the song into a loop with, "...Go to the store, get us some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall...".

In order to make the song progressively more drunk, I sectioned out the lyrics and started them off at a normal language. Then, I incrementally changed select sections to get louder, longer, or more slurred until eventually, toward the end of the song, it it very obvious the the singer(s) of this song is/are very drunk. I also added a few out-of-song phrases that the initial singer says. These also start off as sober comments until at the end, our singer throws up. Throwing up, however, does not deter them from finishing the song.

Thank you,
Vicki
