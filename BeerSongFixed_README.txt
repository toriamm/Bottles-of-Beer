Hello Professor Tapia!

The Beer Song from the book was so bland, a little confusing and not always grammatically correct, so I fixed that.

An example from that song would be:


2 bottles of beer on the wall
2 bottles of beer.
Take one down.
Pass it around.
1 bottles of beer on the wall
1 bottle of beer on the wall
1 bottle of beer.
Take one down.
Pass it around.
No more bottles of beer on the wall


I found that while reading all 99 verses, I would often get confused by the doubling up of “bottles of beer on the wall” so I did a couple of thing to make the change of verses distinct.

First, I added the word “more” to the last line of the verse so that every verse ended with “(Number) more bottles of beer on the wall”.

Afterwards, I created a space after each verse to really separate them from each other.

Grammatically speaking, the second to last verse is incorrect by saying, “1 bottles of beer…” at the end. I know that early in the coding, we specified that when the number of beers equals 1, the word “bottles” would become singular. However, that only worked for the verse where there is only one beer left, it did not take into account the end of verse two, so I duplicated the statement to work for the end of verse two as well.

Lastly, I added some exclamation points (!).

Here is the example of my fixed code:


2 bottles of beer on the wall!
2 bottles of beer!
Take one down!
Pass it around!
1 more bottle of beer on the wall.

1 bottle of beer on the wall!
1 bottle of beer!
Take one down!
Pass it around!
No more bottles of beer on the wall.


As far as fixing it goes, that was all I did. I hope this explanation is satisfactory.

Regards,
Vicki
